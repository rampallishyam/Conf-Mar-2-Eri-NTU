# Conf-Mar-2-Eri-NTU
Contains the all the files made for this conference

Use spyder to run the code.

Code Description for the file: Mar2_Code_With functions.py

Approach:
1. Considers the real loactions of defined AV_stops and parking locations
2. applies the heuristic developed for this research work and generates Vehicle-stop pairs
3. For each vehicle TSP is implemented where different algorithms can be tested
4. Results include Total vehicle travel miles.

Limitations:
1. TSP for different origin and destination is not optimal
2. The heuristic does not sort the demand values however it is not clear if this is a limitation
